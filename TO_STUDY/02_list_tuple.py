Question : diff bw list and tuple, when do we use tuple

Solution :
in tuple we cannot do item assignment, appending, removing (meaning it is immutable). 

-> we use tuple to make code safe from accidental modification, 
-> also tuple can be made as key in dict
-> more memory efficiency and fast than list because of immutability
