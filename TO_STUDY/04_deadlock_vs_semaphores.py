Deadlocks : are undesirable situations where processes get stuck waiting for each other indefinitely, 
usually due to improper resource allocation and synchronization.

Semaphores : are synchronization tools that help manage access to resources, prevent race conditions,
and avoid deadlocks when used correctly.
